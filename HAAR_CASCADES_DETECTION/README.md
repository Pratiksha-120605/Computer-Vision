👀 Face, Eyes, and Mouth Detection using Haar Cascade – OpenCV
This is a beginner-level computer vision project that uses OpenCV's built-in Haar Cascade classifiers for detecting faces, eyes, and mouth in real-time using a webcam. Haar Cascade is a machine learning-based object detection algorithm trained on positive and negative images to detect objects.

Although Haar Cascade detection is not as accurate as deep learning models, it works well for basic use cases and is a great starting point for understanding object detection in OpenCV.
